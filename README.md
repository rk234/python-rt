# Python-RT

A simple, mostly self-contained python ray tracer written for Pyoneers lessons. The only dependency is [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for outputting rendered images as PNGs. Based off of Peter Shirley's [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) with some simplifications.
