# Rough Lesson Order

The `math_utils` file should be copy-pasted at the start of the lessons, no need for walking through implementing boring math boilerplate.

1. Outputting a PNG image
2. The Ray class
3. The Camera class and creating a sky gradient
4. The Scene and SceneObject classes
5. The Sphere class & Ray-Sphere intersection + normal vectors
6. Abstract material class and Lambertian (diffuse) material
7. Metal material and Emissive material (Light sources)

#### *If time permits:*

8. Ray-Plane intersection

Day 1: 1, 2, 3

Day 2: 4, 5

Day 3: 6, 7, 8
